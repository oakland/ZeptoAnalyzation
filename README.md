# ZeptoAnalyzation
Analyzation of Zepto source code

---

Compared with jQuery, Zepto is more neat and clear. After diving deeply into JS, I think the best way to grasp a programe language is learn it by reading clear and neat libraries or frameworks. Both Zepto.js and Underscore.js are good choice. I've already setup a Underscore.js analyzation repo before, and this is a repo to analyze Zepto.js.

This repo will be updated gradually. Hope you can star this repo and fork it to contribute. Let's learn JS together.
